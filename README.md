## Features

- Processed a Telco dataset with over 7,000 entries
- Cleaned and encoded categorical data, handled missing values
- Engineered tenure-related features for better churn segmentation
- Trained and evaluated:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost Classifier
- Achieved highest model accuracy of approximately 78.7%
